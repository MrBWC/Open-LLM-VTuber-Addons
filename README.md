Twitch Chat Addon (BETA - Work in Progress)
This addon lets your Twitch chat interact directly with the AI! Think of it as giving your viewers a voice inside your VTuber's world. It's still under heavy development, so expect some wonky bits. 😅

Current Status:

✅ Audio Playback: The AI can hear and respond to your chat's messages.
❌ Movement: The visual aspect of the VTuber reacting to chat is currently broken.
